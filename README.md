# Movie-data-pipeline
This project builds a Python ETL pipeline using Pandas and the OMDb API to process MovieLens data.
It cleans movie titles, enriches records with directors and box office details, and loads results into SQLite.
The final database supports SQL-based insights on top movies, genres, and directors.
